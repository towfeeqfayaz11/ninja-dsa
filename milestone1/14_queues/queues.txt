# QUEUE -> FIFO
# built-in queue
   => queue can be implemented using queue package
      > import queue
        q = queue.Queue()          # initializes queue     (FIFO)

        q.put(1)                   # adds element to queue (add to last)
        q.put(3)
        q.put(5)

        while not q.empty():
        	print(q.get())         # removes and returns the first element in the queue



# a queue should have five functionalties
 1) enqueue()       --> add element to end of queue (or rear part of queue)
 2) dequeue()       --> remove element from front of queue
 3) front()         --> return the front most element from queue
 4) size()          --> should return the size/total elements in queue
 5) isEmpty()       --> returns true/false based on if the queue is empty or not
